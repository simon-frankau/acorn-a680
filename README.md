# Acorn A680

Roughly 20 years ago, when I was involved in the Cambridge University
Computer Preservation Society, I was given three
[A680](https://www.computinghistory.org.uk/det/16155/Acorn-A680/) main
boards by an ex-Acorn employee.

I've not done much with them, and thought I should document these
boards a little! The machine itself is pretty well-documented on
[Chris's
Acorns](http://chrisacorns.computinghistory.org.uk/RISCiXComputers.html#A680).

As the A680 was a prototype-only machine, I'm not entirely sure if
these boards ever had a case - they've got a little plastic foot on
the back to allow them to rest on a surface without being mounted in a
case.

They're quite clearly prototype-y - they've all got bodge wires on
them, pretty much everything's socketed, EPROMs for ROMs, etc. One of
them has a little daughterboard to adapt the surface-mount CPU to the
socket, and one of them is missing the CPU.
